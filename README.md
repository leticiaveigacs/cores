# CSS Colour Markers üé®

This repository contains a simple example of using CSS to create coloured markers. Each marker is represented by a set of HTML elements styled with CSS to create the appearance of a coloured pen marker.

## HTML Code Structure

The provided HTML code consists of a basic HTML structure that includes a heading `<h1>` and a `<div>` with the class `.container`, which contains three coloured markers represented by `<div>` elements with the class `.marker`. Each marker is composed of two parts: a "cap" represented by a `<div>` with the class `.cap` and a "sleeve" represented by a `<div>` with the class `.sleeve`.

## CSS and Colours

The styling of the markers is defined in the `styles.css` file, which is linked to the HTML document. In the CSS, classes are used to apply specific styles to each part of the marker, such as colour, size, and shape.

The colours of the markers are represented by specific CSS classes such as `.red`, `.green`, and `.blue`. Each class defines a specific colour for the corresponding marker, using properties like `background-color` to set the background colour of the cap and sleeve.

The CSS also includes styles to position and style the parts of the marker to create the desired appearance of a coloured pen marker.

## How to Use üõ†Ô∏è

To view the coloured markers, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You will see three different coloured markers: red, green, and blue.

Feel free to modify the HTML and CSS code to experiment with different styles and colours of markers.
